### 1. Project Title / Headline
**HR Workforce Insights: Employee Demographics & Attrition Dashboard**

A comprehensive, interactive Power BI analytical tool designed to visualize human resource data—focusing on workforce demographics, gender distribution, and key performance indicators to aid in retention strategies.

### 2. Short Description / Purpose
This HR Data Analysis Dashboard is a Power BI report created to help HR professionals and business leaders explore employee data efficiently. The dashboard focuses on highlighting critical workforce metrics such as gender balance, total employee count, and department-wise distribution. It aims to transform raw HR data into actionable insights for better resource management and strategic planning.

### 3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

* 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – The primary data visualization platform used for designing the interactive report.
* ⚙️ **Power Query** – Used for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean, reshape, and prepare the raw data for analysis.
* 🧮 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Utilized to create calculated measures (e.g., Headcount, Gender Ratios) and custom logic for dynamic visuals.
* 🔗 **Data Modeling** – Relationships established between data tables to enable accurate cross-filtering and drill-down capabilities.
* [cite_start]🎨 **Custom Resources** – Integration of static resources (e.g., Male/Female icons) for enhanced UI/UX.

### 4. Data Source
The data used in this dashboard mimics real-world HR datasets.

* **Source Format:** The data is imported into the Power BI Template (`.pbit`) file.
* **Data Structure:** The dataset includes ~[Insert Number of Rows] employee records containing details such as:
    * **Demographics:** Gender, Age, Marital Status.
    * **Job Details:** Department, Job Role, Salary/Hourly Rate.
    * **Status:** Active vs. Attrition data.

### 5. Features / Highlights
Following the recommended analytics structure:

* **Business Problem**
    HR departments often struggle with fragmented data, making it difficult to instantly visualize the gender composition of the workforce or identify which departments have the highest headcount. Manual reporting is time-consuming and prone to errors.

* **Goal of the Dashboard**
    To provide a centralized view of the workforce that allows stakeholders to quickly assess diversity (Gender Split) and operational capacity (Headcount by Department).

* **Walk Through of Key Visuals**
    * [cite_start]**Demographics Overview:** Visual cards utilizing specific icons (Male/Female) to clearly display the gender split within the company[cite: 9].
    * **Departmental Analysis:** Bar or column charts breaking down employee numbers by specific departments (e.g., R&D, Sales, HR).
    * **Attrition/Status Indicators:** Visuals indicating the flow of employees.

* **Business Impact & Insights**
    This tool enables the HR team to monitor diversity goals effectively and allocate resources based on accurate departmental headcount data, reducing the time spent on manual Excel reporting by automating the visualization process.
